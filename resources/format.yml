# Faction plugins to be used by the plugin
#   The plugin supports the following factions plugins: SimpleFaction, FactionMaster, PiggyFactions & FactionsPE.
#   [!] If the plugin you define here does not exist, or you do not define a valid one, the {faction} tag will simply be ignored.
#   To not use any plugins, you can leave a blank space, e.g:
#     factions-plugin: ""
#
#   --- IMPORTANT ---
#   [!] Use plugins provided by Poggit (https://poggit.pmmp.io/)
#   If you use factions plugins that do not come from this source, an error may occur because sometimes those who provide
#   plugins from external sources (such as YouTube) often modify them.
